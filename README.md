/// LIVE FROM THE HELVE HQ WITH DIRECTOR OPERATIVE_ @mothnode⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣
/// Thank you Agents for the journey so far! Through illness, suffering and self-discovery it has all been a blast, met so many amazing creative people over the years and I’m proud to be your friend, brainstormer and collaborator - let’s run forward together.
We are keeping ourselves in check and that means a lot to me, lost too many „friends” to one-sided relationships. Endless creation „till we die”. If you have a project you need help with I’m always here for you.
Here is a bonus snippet of a song I’m working on right now.⁣ Also a quick shoutout to my inspirations that made me find my own voice and identity and helped me immensly through difficult times in life. Here is to you @_omenxiii @gizmolaflare and @killstation to name just a few.
